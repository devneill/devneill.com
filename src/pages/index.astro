                        I'm building a software business and writing about my

                        I also like to run in the mountains, surf in the ocean

            <h2>The Epic Stack</h2>
            <p>
                I focus my open source energy on contributing to Kent C. Dodd's
                Epic Stack. His stack is an awesome starting point for building
                modern web applications and it's what I use when starting
                something new. <a

            <h2>GetFranki</h2>
            <p>
                Chef Ollie is an energetic, charismatic food lover from Cape
                Town. From his work as a major catering provider, he realised
                there is a need for stream-lining how event organisers plan and
                execute their events. Together, we are building a solution to
                this. It's called GetFranki. <a

            <h2>Dreams web app</h2>
            <p>
                Dreams is a savings app that empowers users to save for their
                future, in fun and engaging way. I've been working with the team
                building out new features since 2020. <a

            <h2>Dreams design system</h2>
            <p>
                During my work at Dreams, I realised there was a need to improve
                our frontend processes. Along with the design team, I built out
                their design system. It brought the design and development teams
                closer together and enabled a more consistent user interface
                across our app. <a
